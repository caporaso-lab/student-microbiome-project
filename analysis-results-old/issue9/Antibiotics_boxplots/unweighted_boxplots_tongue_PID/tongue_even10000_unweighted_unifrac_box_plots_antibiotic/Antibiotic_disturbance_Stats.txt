# The tests of significance were performed using a two-sided Student's two-sample t-test.
# Entries marked with "N/A" could not be calculated because at least one of the groups
# of distances was empty, both groups each contained only a single distance, or
# the test could not be performed (e.g. no variance in the groups).
