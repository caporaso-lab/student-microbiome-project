Included in this directory are results correlating alpha diversity vs. variation of beta diversity.
This includes both MAD and mean within individual UniFrac Distances and all combinations with the 3 (PD, richness, Shannon) alpha diversity metrics.
This is to test if more diverse communities are more stable.
Currently, only plots and no statistics are here but will be added.
Also included are alpha diversity values correlated with variation of alpha diversity (CV). 
The R code used is essentially the same as in the Across_body_site_correlations directory.
