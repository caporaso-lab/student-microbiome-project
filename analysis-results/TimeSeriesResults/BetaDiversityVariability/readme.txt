To examine the relationship between various metadata factors on beta diversity variability,
I determined the average and MAD of unifrac distances for each individual for each body site.
I then ran ttest of ANOVA (and Tukey's) for comparisons that had 2 or more factor levels, 
respectively. Some plots were generated for comparisons that had some level of significance.
The script to calculate mean and MAD is in the "TimeSeriesResults" directory one level above this
one. The statistics and plotting scripts are the same as those in the "AlphaDiversityVariability"
directory.
